# Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Information

### About

This application is a fictional restaurant review site where the user is able to filter from a set of local restaurants and explore the reviews. The application is fully responsive, includes ARIA elements to make it accessibility-friendly, and utilizes a service worker to be able to store local files and provide an offline experience.

### Concepts

Concepts, skills, and technologies used in this project were...

- Service workers for offline usability
- Media queries for responsive designs across various screen sizes
- Accessibility features for impaired users

## Getting Started

This application used a back-end server to display the proper map and information regarding restaurants. To run the application, make sure to download the files and follow the instructions below.

### Downloading

You may download the application files using your terminal with the following command:

```
git clone "https://github.com/raicalvin/fend-p6-restaurant-reviews-app-stage-1.git"
```

### Running

You may setup a basic Python server on a localHost to run this application. The Python command to run the server depends on your version of Python:

For Python 2.X, run the following command in your terminal once you have CD'ed into the app folder:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

For Python 3.X, run the following command:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

You can then open a blank browser tab and route to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Issues

- Issue 1 - The Leafletjs and MapBox libraries are not properly setup for this project. You can include an API key of your own, but one is not provided as the scope of the project revolved solely on making the site responsive, updating the styles, including a service worker for offline use, and updating the code to meet accessibility standards.
